  </a>

<br>
 <p>This was the 5th homework challenge for the EDX Bootcamp in Front End Development.</p> 

   <p>Our task was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected.
</p> 

 <p>The user is prompted to choose a password length between 8 and 128 inclusive.
</p> 

 <p>We were provided with 4 arrays of data for specific characters the the user could choose to include in their password.
</p> 

* Special Characters
* Numbers
* Lower Case Characters
* Upper Case Characters

 <p>Once a user has selected their chosen characters and password length they will be presented with a random password in the text area field that they can then copy.
</p>
